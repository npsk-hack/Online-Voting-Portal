# Online-Voting-Portal
#### St. Joseph's PU College
Why wait in a long queue when you can vote online from anywhere? Why wait for results if you can get the results as soon as voting is over? We aim to build an online voting portal where citizens of a country/state can vote for their beloved representatives. With complete fool-proof mechanisms, we here try to make voting as unbiased as possible without loopholes to uphold democracy and freedom. We will be building this application with respect to the Indian General Elections
